# Installation

Installation on a bare React Native project.

### npm or yarn

npm:

```sh
$ npm install react-native-screenguard --save
```

yarn

```sh
$ yarn add react-native-screenguard
```

### For Expo user 

If your project is initialized and built with Expo, you need to eject from the managed workflow by running `expo eject` or run `npx expo prebuild` in order to use this library. This allows you to integrate native libraries that are not supported in the managed workflow. Check the Expo documentation below for more details.
